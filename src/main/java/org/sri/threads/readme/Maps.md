## Comparison Table

| **Feature**                | **`HashMap`**                               | **`UnmodifiableMap`**                         | **`Map.ofEntries`**                          | **`ConcurrentHashMap`**                        |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**              | A general-purpose, mutable map implementation. | An immutable wrapper around a `Map` to prevent modifications. | A static method for creating immutable maps with entries. | A thread-safe map implementation that allows concurrent access. |
| **Thread Safety**           | Not thread-safe.                          | Not thread-safe; synchronization needed for safe iteration. | Not thread-safe (map is immutable).          | Thread-safe and optimized for concurrent access by multiple threads. |
| **Null Keys/Values**        | Allows null keys and values.              | Typically does not allow `null` keys/values (depends on original map). | Does not allow `null` keys or values.        | Does not allow `null` keys or values.           |
| **Modifiability**           | Can be modified (entries can be added/removed). | Immutable; entries cannot be modified.       | Immutable; entries cannot be modified.       | Modifiable (entries can be added/removed), but thread-safe. |
| **Use Case**                | General-purpose map for key-value storage. | Useful when you need a map that cannot be modified after creation. | Quick creation of small, immutable maps.     | Used in multi-threaded environments where thread safety is required. |

| **Atomic Operations**       | No built-in support for atomic operations. | No built-in support for atomic operations.    | No built-in support for atomic operations.   | Supports atomic operations like `putIfAbsent()`, `remove()`, and `replace()`. |
| **Common Use Case**         | Applications that require key-value pairs with frequent modifications. | Making a map immutable and preventing any further changes. | Creating small, fixed maps for quick use.    | Applications with heavy concurrent access, such as caching or counters. |

## Key Differences

### 1. **Thread Safety**
- **`HashMap`**: Not thread-safe. Not suitable for concurrent access.
- **`UnmodifiableMap`**: Not thread-safe by default, but the map's immutability makes it safe from structural modifications. Synchronization is required for safe iteration in multi-threaded environments.
- **`Map.ofEntries`**: Thread safety is not a concern as the map is immutable.
- **`ConcurrentHashMap`**: Thread-safe, supports concurrent access with minimal locking, and is designed for high-concurrency scenarios.

### 2. **Null Keys/Values**
- **`HashMap`**: Allows `null` keys and values.
- **`UnmodifiableMap`**: Typically does not allow `null` keys/values (depends on the underlying map).
- **`Map.ofEntries`**: Does not allow `null` keys or values.
- **`ConcurrentHashMap`**: Does not allow `null` keys or values.

### 3. **Atomic Operations**
- **`HashMap`**: Does not support atomic operations.
- **`UnmodifiableMap`**: Does not support atomic operations (since it is immutable).
- **`Map.ofEntries`**: Does not support atomic operations (since it is immutable).
- **`ConcurrentHashMap`**: Supports atomic operations like `putIfAbsent()`, `remove()`, `replace()`, and `computeIfAbsent()`, which are essential in concurrent environments.

## Conclusion

- **`HashMap`** is ideal for single-threaded applications where thread safety is not a concern.
- **`UnmodifiableMap`** is useful when you need to ensure that a map cannot be modified after creation.
- **`Map.ofEntries`** is suited for creating small, immutable maps with a predefined set of entries.
- **`ConcurrentHashMap`** is the best choice for high-concurrency, multi-threaded applications that require thread-safe operations and atomic modifications.

Choose the appropriate map implementation based on your specific needs related to thread safety, atomicity, and mutability.

## Comparison Table

| **Feature**                | **`Collections.unmodifiableMap()`**                    | **`Map.ofEntries()`**                      | **`Collections.synchronizedMap()`**                     |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mutability of Underlying Data** | **Not immutable**. Changes to the underlying map reflect in the unmodifiable map. | **Truly immutable**. Neither the map nor its entries can be modified. | **Mutable**. The map can be modified safely in multithreaded contexts. |
| **Wrapper vs Native**      | **Wrapper** over an existing map, preventing modifications via the wrapper. | **Native immutable map**, optimized for immutability. | **Wrapper** over an existing map, adding synchronized access to methods. |
| **Thread Safety**          | Not thread-safe for iteration; external synchronization is required. | Thread-safe for iteration due to immutability. | Thread-safe for both modifications and iteration. |
| **Modification Risk**      | Changes in the original map reflect in the unmodifiable map. | No risk; the map is immutable. | No risk of unsynchronized access; all operations are synchronized. |
| **Concurrency Mechanism**  | None. Unmodifiable, but not synchronized.              | None. Immutability eliminates concurrency issues. | Synchronizes all method calls using intrinsic locks. |
| **Performance**            | Depends on the underlying map; incurs no synchronization overhead. | Optimized for immutability; compact and fast for read operations. | Slower in multithreaded environments due to synchronized access. |
| **Use Case**               | Prevent accidental modifications in single-threaded contexts. | Ideal for creating read-only maps with no modification needs. | Suitable for multithreaded environments needing synchronized access. |

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. `Collections.unmodifiableMap()`
- **How It Works:**  
  Wraps an existing map to provide a read-only view. Any attempt to modify the map via the wrapper will throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`.
- **Limitation:**  
  The underlying map can still be modified directly if you have access to it, making this not truly immutable.
- **Thread Safety:**  
  Not inherently thread-safe; you must externally synchronize blocks of code during iteration.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  Map<String, String> originalMap = new HashMap<>();
  originalMap.put("key1", "value1");

  Map<String, String> unmodifiableMap = Collections.unmodifiableMap(originalMap);

  // Throws UnsupportedOperationException
  unmodifiableMap.put("key2", "value2");

  // Modifying the original map reflects in the unmodifiable view
  originalMap.put("key2", "value2");
  System.out.println(unmodifiableMap.get("key2")); // Prints "value2"
  ```

---

### 2. `Map.ofEntries()`
- **How It Works:**  
  Creates a truly immutable map from scratch. Once created, neither the map nor its entries can be modified.
- **Thread Safety:**  
  Safe for multithreaded environments because of immutability.
- **Performance:**  
  Optimized for fast read operations; uses compact internal data structures.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  Map<String, String> immutableMap = Map.ofEntries(
      Map.entry("key1", "value1"),
      Map.entry("key2", "value2")
  );

  // Throws UnsupportedOperationException
  immutableMap.put("key3", "value3");
  ```

---

### 3. `Collections.synchronizedMap()`
- **How It Works:**  
  Wraps an existing map and synchronizes all method calls using the intrinsic lock of the map instance.
- **Thread Safety:**  
  Thread-safe for both modifications and iteration. However, iteration requires external synchronization to be safe.
- **Performance:**  
  Slower than `ConcurrentHashMap` because all operations are synchronized, locking the entire map.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
  Map<String, String> synchronizedMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(map);

  // Thread-safe modification
  synchronizedMap.put("key1", "value1");

  // Thread-safe iteration requires synchronized block
  synchronized (synchronizedMap) {
      for (Map.Entry<String, String> entry : synchronizedMap.entrySet()) {
          System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
      }
  }
  ```

---

## Key Takeaways
- **`Collections.unmodifiableMap()`**: Prevents modifications through the wrapper but is not truly immutable. The underlying map can still be changed.
- **`Map.ofEntries()`**: Provides a fully immutable and thread-safe map, ideal for read-only use cases.
- **`Collections.synchronizedMap()`**: Ensures thread safety by synchronizing all operations but may cause performance bottlenecks in high-concurrency environments.

## When to Use?
| **Scenario**                              | **Recommended Option**                    |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Need a read-only map but can tolerate underlying changes. | `Collections.unmodifiableMap()`           |
| Need an immutable map with no changes allowed. | `Map.ofEntries()`                         |
| Need a thread-safe map in a multithreaded context with limited concurrency. | `Collections.synchronizedMap()`           |
| Need high performance in a multithreaded context. | Consider using `ConcurrentHashMap`.       |

# Thread Safety in Java Maps: When to Synchronize During Iteration

## Overview
When working with maps in a multithreaded environment, it’s essential to understand which implementations are inherently thread-safe and which require additional synchronization to avoid `ConcurrentModificationException`.

## Table: Synchronization Requirements for Different Map Implementations

| **Collection Type** | **Thread-Safe for Iteration?** | **Needs Manual Synchronization?** | **Reason** |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| `Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>())` | 🚨 No | ✅ Yes | Basic operations (put, get, remove) are synchronized, but iteration is **not thread-safe** unless manually synchronized. |
| `ConcurrentHashMap` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Uses a segmented locking mechanism, so multiple threads can iterate and modify safely. |
| `Map.ofEntries(...)` (Immutable Map) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | It’s **read-only**, so there’s no modification during iteration. No synchronization needed. |
| `Collections.unmodifiableMap(map)` | 🚨 No | ✅ Yes | The structure is fixed, but iteration is still **not inherently thread-safe** because the underlying map could be modified externally. |
| `HashMap` | 🚨 No | ✅ Yes | Not thread-safe at all. |
| `Hashtable` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Fully synchronized but **slow** compared to `ConcurrentHashMap`. |

## Best Practices
- **Use `ConcurrentHashMap` whenever possible** for a fully thread-safe and high-performance solution.
- **Use `Map.ofEntries(...)` for immutable maps** where no modifications are expected.
- **Wrap with `Collections.synchronizedMap()` if needed, but always synchronize manually during iteration**.
- **Avoid `Hashtable` unless working with legacy code**, as it is slower than `ConcurrentHashMap`.

## Example: Proper Synchronization with `synchronizedMap`
```java
Map<String, String> syncMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>());

synchronized (syncMap) { // Manual synchronization required for iteration
    for (Map.Entry<String, String> entry : syncMap.entrySet()) {
        System.out.println(entry.getKey() + " -> " + entry.getValue());
    }
}
```

## Summary
- **No need to synchronize iteration** for ✅ `ConcurrentHashMap` and `Map.ofEntries(...)`
- **Everything else needs manual synchronization** if iterating while other threads may modify the map.

Understanding these differences ensures that you avoid unexpected `ConcurrentModificationException` and achieve safe, efficient multithreading in Java.
